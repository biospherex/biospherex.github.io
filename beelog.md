We installed two hives at Lotus Garden towards the end of April, which we’ve named Lotus Hive and Moon Hive.
 
The lotus hive is doing extremely well. There are around 6 full combs built out, with 3 partial combs underway. 
We were able to spot the queen doing her thing on an edge comb. We’ll mark her next time. 
 
The moon hive on the other hand, seems to be struggling. There were a couple combs that had fallen off the top 
bars and were being built on the floor of the hive. These were picked up and placed on an elevated platform. We 
think that the queen of this hive might be no longer since there were queen larva seen in the combs. We 
speculate this hive could be struggling due to a variety of factors: 1) The box the queen was initially 
stored in fell into the hive and was not removed -- the bees have since built comb around it.  This might 
indicate that they did not adopt the initial queen... 2) There wasn’t enough sugar water starter or 3)The flow rate 
of the water was too great.  
We provided the same amount of sugar water starter to both hives, but perhaps this hive needed extra assistance and could 
have used more.  3) The hive is in a part of the food forest which receives less sunlight (between two fruit trees).
