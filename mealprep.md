## Meal Prep as Group Practice

### INTRO (THEORY)
Most recently popularized by Bodybuilding culture. Meal prep has been a staple of food traditions in many cultures and kitchens.

It is an idea with which I have been enamored with over many periods and trials. It is a practice which makes sense so immediately, the logical aspiration, the “having my shit together”-ness of it. But inevitably, for as many times I’ve started meal prep, I’ve equally had it disrupted due to work travel, scheduling conflicts, and general lack of discipline. Each time I would start and each time I would fail gradually and without much fanfare. For I know I don’t have the discipline and that I have other obligations. Yet to meal prep, must we all be great men (and women)?

### BEYOND INDIVIDUALISM
With Biosphere(x) developing its practices and systems, striving towards autonomy and group resilience.
It was clear to me that b(x)’s values and prediliction to group meals and traditional food knowledge was fertile ground to experiment with my ideas. 

Inspired by the many community groups doing great work building traditions of food in NY and elsewhere (see [Three Stone Hearth](http://www.threestonehearth.com/), the ancestral-minded community-supported worker-cooperative kitchen) and my own personal experience with meal prep.

I proposed implementing a fusion of the two ideas into our group’s practice, transforming a solitary activity of personal development into one of social bonds and community development. 

While social dinners were great via Food not Bombs and community dinners like Woodbine and biosphere(x), ourselves, in my experience, these meals can often be transient, allowing me to meet many people with various thematic intersections, but rarely leading to the consistency I craved. Even if routinely scheduled, it wasn’t a regular co-participatory experience for me and, perhaps, the majority of participants.

My thesis was that meal prep, on the other hand, is a much more fundamental way of life. 
It is a persistence of self-care, an investment that focuses on building nutritional abundance and surplus for the week ahead full of challenges. One in which we can’t necessarily give a second thought to that take-out burrito. Or perhaps if more spartan, lentils and rice or opening up that can of tuna. In our novelty-seeking world, that can get tiring, and I, inevitably, resume to the standard american way. McDonalds around the corner. The local pizza slice or chicken shop if I’m feeling marginally healthier.

As I spend more time investing in biosphere(x), and our building a community of the future, I start seeing the possibilities of surrendering one’s vulnerability to group-care, appealing to the greater collective.
Where self-care fails, I hypothesize we should consider how to build a system around us, preferably one of resilience and anti-fragility. One in which we not only are producing food but also producing skills, experimenting with ideas, developing a relationship with our tribe. 
When put in this context, it’s harder to give up. I love my brothers and sisters in a way that is hard to describe. I would never fail them. 

Cooking (or consuming) for one, personally, is an act of improvisation and scavenging.  
Cooking for one for days is an act of improvisation and scavenging but with a little more care and planning.
Cooking for a group makes one less lazy to take short cuts. We want the best for everyone and ourselves, but is it sustainable ? 
Cooking for a group for days is an act of love. 

Together, we are sharpening our knives, experimenting with ideas, developing a system and practice, and ever aligning in solidarity. Every time I eye that bag of candy or chips. I’m less likely to indulge knowing that I have a meal in the fridge, already neatly packaged, especially one in which positive energy (and skill!) our crew put into the meals. 

### POEISIS - MEAL PREP #1, Sunday, May 7th, 2017

Despite not clearly synthesizing this thought process, the biosphere(x) core quickly agreed to give it a shot. Perhaps, many had similar experiences that I had trying to implement meal prep on and off-and-on basis. After very briefly introducing the idea a month or so again, and then in more in-depth two weeks ago, we finalized on a Sunday to start.
 
A few other days of the week were tossed around as meal prep does not necessarily have to occur on Sunday, before the start of the work week, but due to scheduling conflicts for other days, Sunday turned out to be the day that worked best. 

Planning was easy and collaborative in our distributed group chat. B(x) head of food R&D, Josh, quickly posted an idea for a vegan curry dish, and we easily decided to meet at his place given his equipment and his deliberate kitchen setup. 

Procurement was then split up via volunteering.

>me [2:00 PM] What should I buy <Josh>?
Josh [2:08 PM] Any word on how many folks are coming to meal prep?
[2:08] Sorry tried to send that a couple hours ago.
[2:13] We need shallot garlic ginger beans (kidney? Chickpea?) Kabocha squash(or acorn/butternut) TONS of coconut milk fresh chili cilantro(if everyone can eat it) and lemongrass if we can find. If anyone is passing through Chinatown there's a Thai grocer where you can get cheap curry paste and lime leaves.

Saturday evening, I scoped my local grocery store. Buying bulk beans (on sale for $.99/lb !!), dried peppers, and coconut milk. 

Sunday, day of, people trickled in around the same time late afternoon. We had an easy order of operations due to the relative simplicity of the recipe we chose. Additional groceries were procured from a local grocery store. Chris came through with carrots harvested from Lotus garden to supplement a healthy pantry. Josh’s kitchen was already well set up for stations as we moved around. At times the dining room table was used of additional cutting space.

As we rotated on stations, hung out, played music from Maddy and Josh’s extensive collection of cassette mixtapes, after a few quick hours of work and talk, we sat down to dine and continued to chat the rest of the evening away. Splitting up the left overs for the week as the night ended. 

While the scale is small, a couple meals over a week, we are gradually intertwining our lives.. I jokingly offer the idea of only eating this meal for the rest of the year and incrementally improving the recipe. It is a testament to this group that Josh immediately responded with, “I’m so down”. I am already excited for the next one. 

### LEARNINGS
Learnings for the second run of Meal Prep

* More chilli paste
* More coconut milk (went out to buy some more mid-cooking) 
* Add hardy greens (collards, kale) 
* Bigger pots
* Soaking beans overnight / cooking beans beforehand 

And there are ever more ideas, improving our tooling, incorporating workouts, baking and coffee roasting subgroups.

Hey all I just approximated the macros/macros for our meal prep. Depending on serving size its gonna be 780-1100calories (I estimated high because I eat a lot) 28-40grams protein (complete amino profile) 140-180 grams carbs 16-27 g fat.  You can definitely tweak theportioning though. (this is taking into account for rice) this meal is particularly high in vitamin k and a as well as b1 b3 b6 and folate. Mineral content is ok as well. Over 100% DV for copper iron manganese and phosphorous.  Had a lot of fun hope to dial this in!

Meals roughly came out to $7 person for around 3-4 meals. 

In sum, our first biosphere(x) member meal prep was wildly successful. 

It is by nature a more limited group, but it is focused on building quality over quantity. Eating one base meal over a period. 
One event which scales to more thoroughly integrate our lifestyles.  As I go through the week, I remember our fond times building towards a goal. 
Excited to eat the curry as the aromatics continue to steep in the fridge :-)

If these types of experiments are of interest, consider joining biosphere(x) as a crew member. While in our current stage, we may remain small. Help us find the way to scale. That being said, these are the early days, we all know cautionary tales of projects that start off strong but fizzle, but I am very encouraged by the intersection of pragmatism and permanent culture. Here’s to many more days, weeks, months, and years of meal prep.
